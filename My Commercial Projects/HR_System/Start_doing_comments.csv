"In fairness, I've only met with Ben for a formal discussion once, and this was only for an hour, so an assessment of start / stop / continue is not easy. Perhaps with hindsight, allocating more time would have served to gain a more thorough understanding of the requirement.reply to clients emails. work with clients to help them. follow through with what he says he'll do. Getting the team that support him to be more proactive......evidence is that Andrew did a great job but there is not much happening now.Tighter follow up on agreed actions.More open ended questions"
"Nothing in particular. Its a difficult one, sometimes its taken 5 months to get a simple OBA code added to our account, email receipts coming back saying 'message not read' or 'email deleted' which I still have. Apparently it was down to BT internet (?), then it was all sorted apparently.Monthly Designated Afternoon courtesy Calls  To find out how things are Progressing  "
"I think that generally the APS need to refine the overall value proposition regarding the benefits of the APS and to be able to adapt this to different points of need. This is particulary important when the brand of the APS is still developing and emerging. It is not yet well known enough to 'command' instant membership. A key part of that value proposition is what the Association is trying to do for the industry as a whole, which is fantastic and sometimes this is lost.  I also think Graham has a great opportunity to connect people across the APS network which is a key role for anyone managing relationships. This would be of great value."
"Confirming meeting points in writing a bit quicker.More face to face time with the sales team to develop the profile of the APS in their eyes.Act as a 'door opener' by making the core cadre of APS more accessible and known to newer and potential members. Hence building the confidence and engagement across the association. give more specific details give an overall summary of our account face to face meeting, site visit. Following up on things as promised. An account manager is the front of a company for a client. He should channel and own all our communication with Royal Mail."
"Defining more clearly how different parts of the APS (people, roles and ) work together. Not just reporting the actions and outputs). This would facilitate better understanding of the goals and aspirations.Diarise regular monthly/bi monthly catch up calls. Quicker follow-up..  Then it continued so no idea. I just prefer to phone Royal Mail Business line now, its a bit of a joke to be honest."
"She should be more in contact by email to assess how the business is doing, what needs might we have and offer new products that might be suitable for us.  For example, I have noticed you've got the Tracked 48 service which I do not have.  I would have expected the account manager to offer me that kind of service for example.  "
"Firstly it is important to say Adrian is a really nice guy but!!!
Returning phone calls,actually answering the phone would be great, returning email questions, actually calling on customers and being proactive"
"Similarly to the 'STOP DOING' below, I have not observed anything in my interactions with Andrew that he should start doing. Getting to know what it is we are trying to achieve as a business. Previous business managers have rung me on a monthly basis. Allina has never done this in years.Engage with senior members of our team before working with more junior members"
She is already very good in helping me. Would be nice be able to give better discounts to good clients like myself
"Nothing, he is professional and polite.Billy is spot on, can't fault him"
Diarise future ongoing meetings.Jake is often out of office when assistance is required.Only ever had one correspondence with Royal Mail in 2 years 
"I have nothing against Kelvin, but Royal Mail should offer a delivery service to every letterbox in a prescribed area that can be specified more flexibly than by the first part of a post code (i.e. XXn n--). We needed  to target about 3000 homes that straddled two such post code bands, but didn't include all of these two bands. We would have been happy to specify ranges of postcodes, based on the full post code."
"**FIRSTLY COLLIN IS NO LONGER MY ACCOUNT MANAGER, I THINK IT MAYBE AN ALEX YET I HAVE YET I HAVE NO RECORDS IN MY EMAIL WHO MY ACCOUNT MANAGER IS IM NOT EVEN CLEAR ABOUT**

Also my grievances are with the way the situation was handled as a whole by ALL staff we spoke to (Except for the 1, Carly Fletcher)

This survey has come at a good time since the latest appalling way in which we have been treated by Royal Mail.

Last week our account was suspended without ANY warning, it was only until we tried to manifest at the end of the day we realised there was an issue that our payment was over due by 6 days.

This left us in dire straights &amp; the 170 orders ready for dispatch that day did not leave us creating bedlam.

I firstly tried to call customer services who passed me to my account manager, thinking this would be the best port of call, he (Alex?) couldnt do anything for us, the only real info given was that this WOULD take 72 hours to fix &amp; nothing could be done theres no flick of a switch, he hastily passed me through to the accounts team, passed the buck &amp; thats the last I heard from him! since.

The accounts team were very blunt with no empathy or help whatsoever, just repeating the same line nothing can be done, it'll take 72 hours no flick of a switch, no concern in the slightest apart from to get me off the phone &amp; to hell with my business!

I instantly cleared the entire balance, my company turns over &Acirc;&pound;2m a year, the balance was no issue just an over sight with NO warning, no email, even during the setup we were told this could never happen.

This fobbing off happened repeatedly on numerous calls, my business that has taken 6 years to build was completely at your mercy &amp; you couldn't give a toss, I was left up **** creek with no paddle I think is the term.

My business that has spent over &Acirc;&pound;500,000 with you!!

We've recently moved to Click &amp; Drop &amp; must be nearing &Acirc;&pound;100k py, yet for 5 years before this we were using the post office, buying stamps from Shiphay post office Torquay, see how there turnover has diminished since we moved to click &amp; drop it will be very noticeable.

The arrears in which we received the suspension was approx &Acirc;&pound;4,000

So finally, after emptying all the local post offices of stamps to try &amp; clear the backlog of our orders &amp; with the blind panic we had trying to fix this completely unnecessary &amp; available mess, my store manager made one last plea &amp; was lucky enough to speak to Carly Fletcher, who could see that we had paid &amp; turned the account on again in an instant, in a flick of a switch.


She out of ALL I spoke to including my account manager was the only one who gave a damn &amp; helped.


To further this, on numerous occasions the C&amp;D has completely gone down on us leaving us in limbo on a number of occasions, we dont get any reprieve or apology when that happens &amp; its frequent enough.


Now we have a new issue, since this episode the sorting office are now going through all of our mail, weighing it, sizing it &amp; picking out anything which is wrong &amp; stopping it. This never happened before, we are now targets.

The driver was told not to pick up from us after it was reinstated, they were so quick to suspend the account yet we had to physically tell him it was re-instated &amp; show him our emails, luckily we caught him as he drove by.


So clearly after the whole embarrassment of looking like we cant pay (take into account our spend &amp; turnover), the avoidable unsent post &amp; the unnecessary blind panic to try &amp; get our orders to our customers. 
Then clearly after all of this that you've dished out to us we are also now a target for the sorting office &amp; they now have it in for us.
This is not how I would treat a customer paying &Acirc;&pound;100k per year.


And to cap it off, the day after the suspension the 20th low &amp; behold a letter dropped though the door saying payment reminder, sent a few days before on a 48hr post


Needless to say, yesterday I called DPD &amp; DHL, ive got a call with MyHermes &amp; Ipost later

"WE HAVE VERY LITTLE CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANYONE AT ROYAL MAIL. ANY PROBLEM WE HAVE WE FACE ALONE. OUR INVOICING SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY DOWN AND PAYMENTS ARE TAKEN AT CONFUSING POINTS. I HAVE ENQUIRED ABOUT A REP FOR THE BUSINESS AS WE HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR A LONG TIME AND OUR BUSINESS SPEND PER ANNUM IS HIGH AND BEEN MET WITH NO FEEDBACK OR RESPONSE. THE ONLY REASON WE CONTINUE TO USE ROYAL MAIL IS BECAUSE OF THE PRICING. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE AND I HAVE NOT HAD AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF ROYAL MAIL FOR ALMOST 18MONTHS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT PAMELA ALONE, THIS IS ABOUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS MODEL AND YOUR LACK OF COMPASSION FOR CUSTOMERS NEEDS. "
We have no additional requirements at present for any further services that we are currently using so there is nothing at this time we think Fiona should be adding to our service. She keeps in regular contact with us to make sure we have no problems and is always responsive to us when we initiate contact with her.
Asking for a pay rise! Gareth has ALWAYS picked up the phone and been super efficient at answering any questions we have during the setup and ongoing questions during our relationship. He suggests other products which he thinks we'd find useful and has been the best account manager I've worked with in a long time. replying to emails and communication. Following through with what he says he's going to do. Chasing up relevant claims and issues.
"empathy, listening and not just repeating Royal Mail management speak.
Listen, understand and represent customer issues and experiences"
"Testing his/her employees more about what we need to know to sell or even enhance the dishes on offer. This would create consistency in the restaurant&acirc;€™s message, regardless of the employee asked. Maybe create documents for each dish (how it has been cooked, where it comes from, specifics, etc.), which should be handed to all employees. The employees should be tested at each briefing to make sure they&acirc;€™ve learnt the restaurant&acirc;€™s menu in depth.Summer uniform; air conditioning and heating system for the entrance area; elimination of pigeons from the awning; deep clean of the area in front of the main door"
"giving compliments, helping more. more appreciation. freeing up more time for external activities, trade fair, cooking on location, etc,More attention to how personnel wants to develop personally"
"Work with iPad or similar to make work more efficient. For houseman that they can order linen digitally. Now double work, first writing down and then enter into the computer."
Happy with what he does
call more often
A monthly 5-min catch up call will be good.
Very Happy with Joanne
regular contact
Paula is very helpful so no suggestions 
More calls to check on feedback / follow up e.g. recommend we set up RM tracked services for a 3 month trial. There hasn't been a follow up on how we are finding it
"I've not heard from Stephanie in weeks, which given the impending October 8th deadline, is very disappointing.  She should have at least checked in to see how we are getting on.  This is the single biggest change we have had to go through as a company in 8 years of trading!"
"Actively looking for ways to assist , being proactive about setting meetings up, being the voice of the customer"
"She was going to come back to me regarding us not receiving royal mail bags to send post out in, i have since emailed regarding this and had no reponse over a month later."
more with click and drop functionality 
There is nothing specific I could mention.
"Hassan is a very nice guy. He suffers through the bureaucracy of Royal Mail.  Royal Mail systems and procedures are what I have a real problem with. However, Hassan should tell me the complaints process more clearly. Nothing happens when I complain to him. He did give me another managers contact but they were worse and never even replied."
Adams great couldn't improve him
Nothing
"Be more available 
chasing internal resources  more quickly 
Make sure she is supportedd"
MONTHLY CALLS TO ENSURE THAT FOLLOW UP ON ANY QUERIES IS ALWAYS MET 
Nothing as far as we are concerned other then getting better support from the company itself when the problem is due to another department i.e. international
Everything is fine
"Recognise the confidence that business contacts have in your input and that the levels of information sharing/problem resolution will be consistent with that relationship, sometimes operating outside the immediate levels defined by job titles.   "
"Running Royal Mail! She seems to be the only employee who knows  how to get things sorted properly not just in her side of the job, she is a extremely helpful lady and gets things sorted!"
Response time to questions is poor
Keep us updated with all new offers which Royal Mail provides regarding national and international services
Sometimes I had to chase Lauren and didn't receive call backs 
"More help with new procedures. That is our biggest concern using Royal mail, when changes are made.  I think there need to be more Adam's in Royal Mail. He needs to have more authority. "
Would like to be able to get hold of him on the phone a little more easily but the response time is great :-)
"More for customer needs
Where possible "
"Testing his/her employees more about what we need to know to sell or even enhance the dishes on offer. This would make sure the restaurant&acirc;€™s message is consistent, regardless of the employee asked. Maybe create documents for each dish (how it has been cooked, where it comes from, specifics, etc.), which should be handed to all employees. The employees should be tested at each briefing to make sure they&acirc;€™ve learnt the restaurant&acirc;€™s menu in depth."
I dont speak to her enough to merit this type of question
Can't think of anything she should start doing.
keep on doing what hes doing!
Nothing.
I have not met Tracy and from service level Tracy should start following up unfinished queries raised by me and be proactive with regular reviews to discuss the business relationship and what's 'new' or available services from Royal Mail. 
Be proactive if any business request come from others apart from Procurement
Respond to Enquiries.
"1. Offer opportunities/idea's from Royal Mail networking data to help increase volumes.
2. Offer better prices."
My experience has been perfectly adequate with Lucie and I don't see any gaps in her customer service relations...
Feed back to head office that we have better support as a business from your competitors ie Royal Mail would like us to go to barcoded mail at a cost to us of approx. 8K to install the equipment when other companies supply the equipment for us free of charge and service the account if there are any issues with the IT 
I don't know anything that Rhonda should start doing.
I have no genuine complaints with Ning Lee. He is a credit to Royal Mail and is an excellent Account Manager for ourselves
Find a better employer!
"We may require additional postal services, such as som eof the new letterbox tracked services, I dont seem to have an email address for her so that would be helpful with contact details such as a direct phone line. She may have sent one previously but I cant find it"
Happy with all that Alex is doing for us
more monthly meetings with wider business
"Scott should carry on exactly what he is doing, he is a great guy to work with and a huge asset to RM. He responds quickly and will bend over backwards to get the answers and resolutions required."
Proper training for new staff. Employ people who really want to contribute something. The attitude is a bit lax and I think that employees should know clearly what the responsibilities are and that there are consequences
"Returning calls and responding to emails. We have had very little contact with Nick and anytime we call to speak to him we get voice mail, leave a message, no response. Took over 2 months to response to an email regarding postage costs. Anytime he then agrees to call when we are free, he does not? Overall service is poor. We had a great relationship with our previous account manager. "
Nothing different
Ensure all email correspondence is replied to
"Chasing up things we have asked.   
He was going to look into why we do certain things on our system that we do not need to due to the deal we have with royal mail.  Should not need to enter weights.  All our parcels should be signed for but I have to enter this everytime"
"I got no help from anybody during the bad weather and heavy snow at the start of 2018. ..  Royal Mail kept displaying &quot;Normal service&quot; despite the fact over a weeks worth of mail from North Scotland was stuck in the sorting offices.  Utterly disgusting lies.  I kelp telling my customers there were problem in Scotland, but when my customers went to the Royal Mail website it read &quot;Normal Service&quot;.  When I asked for answers I was told to contact customer service. "
I'm sure Tim has more than enough work across his accounts and does not require me to suggest anything else.
We've been really happy with our relationship with Heather.
Billy is totally on top of things in my opinion
acknowledging with proactiveness the issues as explained in detailed way for allowing him and Royal Mail to address the issue accordingly.  
Carry on as he is doing
Can't think of anything extra he can do ;)
He satisfies our requirements but we feel his authority is limited. We have just moved some of our work to DSA which is not due to Tims efforts.
"Take tighter control over Royal Mail colleagues that take too long to provide help or support that Tracy needs. for example are actions diarised and contacts chased vigorously?
This comment may also be more aimed at how slow Royal Mail are to resolve issues that can drag on for months."
"Ensuring that service level reporting is consistent between what we extract from Royal Mail's OBA system, and what is sent to us.
Making us aware of any innovations relevant to the services provided by Royal Mail, as well as any plans to alter account management, such as systems. 
Further ideas as to enhance our international postal provision and how Royal Mail could support that in the future."
"Nothing, she's doing everything we need her to do. Keep up the good work Mel!"
"Nothing that he isn't already doing, great Job!!"
"Maybe contact us, never had any contact with him"
Nothing
I don't know what she should do more
regular contact
"Start taking ownership of issues and ensure they are seen through. On several occasions I have requested help with either adding a service, altering a service or changing some of our company details, instead of being a very simple process this has been lengthy and I have been passed from pillar to post without anyone taking ownership and actually being helpful. This isn't just a Robert issue, it is a Royal Mail issue - no one is willing to help and just tries to give another email address/telephone number to make it someone else's problem. "
get a PA
More interaction with other royal mail departments
nothing
More contact would be helpful without specific issues to discuss
Taking more strict measures to ensure that everyone is doing their jobs properly. Implement rules and sanction if these are not being adhered to. disciplinary measure. When we have a late shift we get  hungry and something needs to be done about that.
Sometimes responses can be a bit slow but not always
"Be more available on the phone, get answerphone a lot
Follow up on calls/emails 
Ensure information promised in calls is sent 
Be more aware of our business and how we operate, I get the impression she has a lot of clients."
Would like to get faster feedback or action when we have an issue or a problem. We have had an outstanding issue for some time now with no solution.
carry on as usual
actually replying to emails that we send him instead of us having to chase him up
I would like more business updates on changes within Royal Mail
A little more proactivity around the way that Royal Mail work. The organisation is so huge and unwieldy it might be nice to understand more about what is on offer
Driving the Royal Mail operation to be much more accountable and transparent about the end to end performance on delivery - there is too much smoke and mirrors about networks being green when we can clearly see our parcels being impacted by pipeline delays from the tracking
Continue her great work
Nothing I can think of
"The only issue I have is that there is no personal interaction, everything is done over the phone or via e-mail. I feel having an account manager for my Hospital in Cardiff based in Leeds loses a lot of the personal touch....
Maybe more trips to the companies she looks after??  Not sure how feasible that is?"
Replying to emails 
nothing new
"Should help business resolve issue promptly, "
Bringing in cakes!
everything else is fine apart from we have not  recived refund for the order which come back to us
I have no problems with Ben
He is a great person but still needs improvements.
"I do not have any comments regarding this case. We are happy with Michael service. He is always very helpful, friendly."
some general email correspondence with updates throughout the year.
Increase awareness of Store Feeder and the associated benefits to the RM Group and her accounts.
Sending biscuits
"arrange annual innovation sessions, where we can find out about RM services that we might not know exist."
I think it would be nice to have monthly catchups. Monitoring of our account and discussions on cost saving.
contacting customers to introduce herself!
Nothing additional required
"I did ask NOT to be contacted by Fiona, her Manager clearly did nothing."
Visiting her clients
N/A - He does everything for us
There is nothing I can think of that Jane should start doing as she is a five star excellent Royal Mail Account Manager!
"contact us more often for an account review/bring us new options, help on board us with new delivery methods/streamlining/technology, visit us"
"Louise is excellent at her job, and treats every call and request with the professionalism and regards to make us feel like a valued customer. Make more time for yourself and your family Louise, enjoy life and those that make it better for you. "
We do not have much contact with Royal Mail unless we contact Royal Mail ourselves.
quarterly engagement meetings with clients.
Communicate by emails.
"when passing queries over to other colleagues to complete, please follow up on them to see if the have been fulfilled as currently they are not."
Communicate by emails.
More regular catch ups and update our online portal copy
Jake should respond within 48 hours as per service level agreement
"Consider looking for another employee in the mail industry that doesn't constantly create a negative working environment for its ever shrinking sales force, who are expected to carry out more duties for the same money, as well as having to regularly re-apply for their own job!"
Communicate by emails.
"Give him more power in changing things according to customer feedback rather than just addding to a forum so feedback is taken on board
And improve relations between departments so if we have issues and can&acirc;€™t get hold of people or get replies, he can chase these up for us"
"Tim should be able to discuss Wholesale matters with me. Though I am not a license holder, we present a lot of items into the Wholesale market place but I have no ability to discuss my issues and concerns. This is not a complaint of Tim but more the system...."
Keep focused on information that is most relevant to the specific customer
"should deal with any issue promptly and resolve it asap. also find best long time solution for customer, i would love to change my manager as my issues dont get resolve "
Nothing
Being more of a bridge between us and the &quot;mysupport&quot;. When we have an issue we are directed to the generic email address which can feel like we dont have an account manager. I would like him to act more on our behalf rather than pushing us to the generic email address.
"Contact us,, never spoken to him!"
I'd like more pricing support. We are an expanding company and don't feel like we are being rewarded for the volumes of parcels we send out in terms of discount.
more regular contact say every 4-6months
Give a call and offer a new price of delivery. I will reduce the quantity of the parcel to send by royal mail. Instead of send me a better price you raised the price. We are going to use Dpd instead now. It is really sad you want to make more money instead of keep the costumers. 
"Make customers aware of changes i.e. new products, products being ended."
TRY HELPING CUSTOMERS
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 
Be more responsive when we have a problem rather than only when we want to spend
Communicating by email in the first instant as the team are often not at their desks
To improve my experience I would have to gain more knowledge and they would have to adapt my work schedule in order to do so and for me to be able to do extra work
start replying to clients emails and correspondence
Weekly shipment consolidated reports 
Looking at the best value services for our business
all perfect
I don't have any suggestions here Ben is Great!
Introduce himself and have more contact with business customers
An auto-response for his emails to ensure we know our messages are safely with him. 
Let us know if there are any changes to our collection/ pick up time schedule. 
Contacting his clients when they ask him to
I can't think of anything.
Regularly contacting us (as Account Manager) to ensure we are being looked after and have everything we need.
He does the right things for us as a business
This is the 3rd time in 1 week I have been sent this survey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"More responsive to emails, it has taken since a meeting in July to get anywhere with regards to new pricing with 2019 forecasts. "
No comment as we were happy
Replying to voicemails left on his direct number.
I've got nothing to write here because I'm really happy with the service that Tracey provides
I am not aware that I have ever spoken to Michelle. If she is our Account Manager then she should call us to introduce herself.

"Stop saying things to people that are unfair (Lotfi),"
to share out the tasks assigned to each employee more evenly
buying more equipment
It would be good if the front office manager treated people equally. He turns a blind eye to many problems and protects certain people who have become untouchable.
Lotfi could start to keep a closer eye on the activities of certain members of his team who sometimes take advantage of his kindness and the fact that he doesn't supervise them at all.

"Hilton is a great employer and above all supports trainees anywhere it can. Our boss of course leaves room for error, but I think that he and also the department leaders rely too heavily on the employees doing their job. Quality controls and security are considered too little so that a lot of potential is wasted and the hotel does not always do justice to the name &quot;Hilton&quot;."
I am very satisfied with the supervisors in the hotel. They have an open ear and help anyone with any type of challenge. I feel very well supported and in a caring enviroment

"giving out praise, showing appreciation, caring, creating a more positive atmosphere, communicating"

praising people personally and verbally
"The canteen food could be more vegetarian-friendly. You work hard, but then as a vegetarian can only eat raw potatoes or salad because the vegetarian option is already gone or because sometimes at the weekend there isn't a vegetarian option. For such a big company that otherwise respects its employees. Food should play a more important role than it has done until now"

Criticising employees more if their manner of work or attitude is not satisfactory for the team and the guests
"taking interest in and informing herself about the tasks of her employees, since there is often a sense of disinterest or cluelessness. There are also other employees who she includes in planning, even though they don't have a management position, since she should be able to show more managerial responsibility and assert herself more."
Unfortunately my boss is not well informed in many areas of work. She should learn these work procedures - so that she can truly allocate tasks and plan. She could also include long-term employees in event planning as well as groups and special guests - or ask how these went in previous years - then she would have more satisfied guests
taking more time for new trainees in the operative departments
I am satisfied with my boss

he does everything the way it should be

"Start communicating more in person, focusing on seeking out strengths of his staff, and trying to develop them and give them a chance for career growth."

Start spending more time with us on site
Start praising people in person for good work. A personal approach is not really represented here. Even though the majority of managers don't do it. For better motivation. Seeing a 'Big Thank You' on the notice board... It's not going to grow on the employees.
Once a quarter a meeting only about and for the banqueting department.
Start showing more interest in team members. He only knows us as employees. Sometimes he thinks we are a good team even though that's not 100% true.
Start smiling more and communicating with employees.
"Start trying to stabilise the rota so it doesn't change 3 times a week. Have training about wine, coffee and food from specialists. Try to increase interest and quality of the food so that we get more guests and therefore higher tips, which are important to us."

"I cannot say anything bad about Katrin Thalmeier. She is a boss who really listens. She always tries to find a solution so that both sides can live with the results. And if it doesn't work out the way it was planned there is still the certainty that Katrin tried everything she could. She takes her time to talk to the employee. She doesn't speak ill of other people's ideas. On the contrary, she always encourages you to approach her with new ideas. She is in the same mood every day. She is not as changeable as the weather. She greets everyone calmly every morning, which I think is very important (this is how the day starts with a boss). She passes her positive and prudent manner on to her team. She treats everyone equally (is polite and understanding to everyone), informs us about new things in conversations. As a boss as well as as a person, Katrin is a professional. She can clearly distinguish between both things. Thank you very much!"

Start pursuing the people who don't want to be responsible during working hours
"Good, my boss is an excellent boss and I don't have any complaints about him."
having confidence that the other staff in the department will do the work on their own and then supervise the work
Encouraging the team members to redouble their efforts for maximum customer satisfaction.
BEING MORE DEMANDING IN EVERYTHING
"in my opinion my boss should pay more attention to the members of his team at work, in the sense that I mean, in the sense that he should value and pay much more attention to those who really sacrifice for their work and make a 100% effort."

Increase financial support for department development and then improve service for guests
Concentrating on giving the guests the best of care to guarantee the highest degree of satisfaction

Yet most of the workers do not feel that way and they tend to change shifts when the manager is there. The main target group of the lobby staff are demobilized soldiers. Due to the attitude of the manager, employees prefer to quit their 'preferential work' in the Hilton because of the attitude of the manager, and therefore, something must be done. "

I DON'T TAKE SIDES AND I LISTEN ACTIVELY.
I AM VERY HAPPY.
HILTON IS ALWAYS THE LEADER ... THANKS TO ITS VALUES.
Mr. Ceyhun has always guided me in my career plans.
"I am satisfied with my hotel in general; however, I think that there is too much discrimination among employees."
"I am not satisfied with my salary as a service staff member. I have applied verbally to human resources and the necessary authorities but they told me to quit my job if I don't like it. Of course, I was upset with this answer. Such an answer from a manager personally demotivated me. The general manager says his door is always open to us but we are not allowed to chat during monthly tea talks. Me and my colleagues are not on good terms and I believe that this is due to the policy of the management. It will continue to be a reason of stress as long as the staff members look for each other's mistakes which will affect the work negatively (my personal opinion). I think that my colleagues will start to work in a more positive manner if a monthly premium is given even only once. Regards, &Atilde;–mer Sakarya"

Applications that are made to human resources are generally rejected without being evaluated.

"Although I am happy with the hotel in general, I believe that the chronic problems are handled in a slow manner."
I really would like it if our salaries could be improved in return for the work we do with so much self-sacrifice but also with pleasure.
I really would like it if our salaries can be reviewed and improved.
Everything is great except for the salaries.
"Our working environment is very nice, we work with pleasure now but I would be very happy if our salaries can also be improved."
"The only problem we have is our salaries, working environment is very nice."
"I am content with my situation, I would be very happy if my salary was a little higher."
I would kindly ask for a rise in the number of employees working in the General Fields and an increase in the salaries.
I would like it a lot if the floors/rooms could be renovated faster and 3-4 floors could be finished in a year.
"We restricted the treats too much, more treats can be offered to the guests (VIP)."
It will be good in terms of satisfaction if the bathroom amenities are improved.
"I would like it a lot if our colleagues in the reception are reminded again about laundry times and especially Pegasus laundry receptions so that our operation does not fail. We would be more than happy to help, as well."
I believe that it would be better in terms of satisfaction to have more amenities in the guest rooms just like the previous Hilton standards.
Improvement of the salaries.
Improvement of the salaries.
Improvement of the salaries. I kindly ask that peas and carrots are used less for the meals.
Improvement of the salaries. I would like it if our uniforms are renewed.
Improvement of the salaries. I would be very happy if snacks are provided together with the morning tea at 10:00.
"Our salaries are given on time, thank you very much. I would like it a lot if our salaries could be improved."
I am very happy to be a part of Hilton. I would like it a lot if our salaries could be higher.
I am very happy to be working at Hilton. I kindly ask my floor trolley to be replaced.
I am happy to be at Hilton. I would like it if our uniforms were replaced.
I am happy to be working at Hilton. I wish our success to continue and hope that our salaries increase sooon.
I love Hilton and I am happy to be working here. I would suggest it to those who want to work here.
"I am very happy with my hotel, I would suggest it to those who want to work here."
"We never heard anything else but Hilton when were children. For us, Hilton represented the top quality. But when I started to work here, I saw that the amenities provided in the rooms were no different than the other hotels. I would like it to be improved."
I am very happy with my department. I am working with great people.
I love my work but I think that my salary is insufficient. I kindly ask the necessary things to be done on this.
"I am happy with the hotel and my department. But while the office staff do not pay dues according to the union agreement, it will compromise neutrality if a department like security that should stay neutral is required to pay union dues. This should be worked out."
"As the security staff, we shouldn't be paying Union dues if we are expected to be neutral during strikes."
Security staff should not be paying union dues.
I would like to thank my manager and our team.
Thank you.
The security team should not be allowed to be a member of the union. You make us dependent on them by making us pay dues to the union. We pay dues while a few departments in the hotel do not. I hope that this injustice will be corrected.
It is important for the sake of neutrality that the security members do not pay union dues and security stays out of scope.
Thank you.
Our salaries could be better.
My manager always respects my opinions and takes them into account. He does everything he can to allow us to improve ourselves.
We exchange our opinions whenever we find time but he doesn't support every step we would take.
The cold and distrustful attitude of our general manager towards f&amp;b department personally drives me out of my mind. It takes away all my will and motivation to work...
"Everything is perfect, I am very happy with my hotel, department and managers."
It is a privilege to be under the brand of Hilton.
"I am quite content with the hotel I am working at. But especially in recent times, the undesired events that occurred in our country and the economic situation unfortunately affected our sector and hotel, as well. We have also been influenced by the working conditions. I hope that everything gets better and the working conditions in our hotel improve accordingly. I am very happy with the managers and supervisors. I really enjoy it to be working with a team who thinks about how things can be better."
I believe that we are working in a good organization.
"Some staff members are always in a rush during busy hours which demotivates other employees. And during these busy hours (which occurs at Manzara), there is so much intervention with the work that employees get confused. They have to give up the work they are doing and deal with other work."
Thank you.
"My name is Ne&Aring;Ÿet &Auml;&deg;&Aring;Ÿcan, I have been working in Conrad for 12 years. I am very happy with Mr. Melih, my manager, he is a great person. I hope he will always be with us. I am personally very happy. I wish him a continued success. Our only problem is the lack of employees. There is a need for employees to increase satisfaction. Regards."
Everything is perfect.
"I have been employed at Conrad Bosphorus Hotel in the food and beverage department, bar, the main restaurant, patisserie, room service and banquet operations [weddings, meetings, cocktails, seminars etc.]. I have been transferred from one place to another all the time. I have always been oppressed and isolated. Why? Because I have always been honest, and tried to avoid flattering, favoritism, unjustly or even justly injuring anyone and earn my money honestly by being a decent and good employee. I have been both oppressed and isolated and labelled as the worst employee!!! The people who caused this include the managers and their flatterers. I undauntedly do my job in the best way despite everything and earn my money honestly and that's why I am set at ease..."
I am proud of working at the scenic restaurant.
My manager is very professionel.
"Mr. Melih is a good manager but the restaurant captain Mr. Orhan makes discrimination among the staff members and favors some people. He bullies the employees other than the ones he favors, which affects our performance negatively."
My department manager is fine but my outlet manager is not competent enough for this position.
Our manager appreciates personal development very much.
It would be good if the carpets in the office could be replaced.
Thank you.
Insufficient equipment.
There shouldn't be any discrimination between Hilton staff and Conrad staff.
"MR. MEL&Auml;&deg;H, the manager of f/b should be dismissed. He doesn't treat the staff well, and makes us carry heavy stuff and do things that are not our duty."
"We kindly ask that tips are transferred also to the kitchen from F&amp;B. It used to be like that but recently, this got reduced unfortunately. We see the efforts of our chief but unfortunately, he is the only one."
"We have a good atmosphere as the kitchen team, our chief helps us in every subject at all times. He guides us in compensating for our deficiencies."
"I think that kitchen staff should also receive tips, which will motivate them more."
We can't find permanent and quick solutions for the needs of the technical service.
"The number of staff members is still insufficient and the situation of the previous year continues, we can't see our future."
Positive in general.
"That my manager approaches everyone with the same distance, that he doesn't make any discrimination, that everyone is in a good mood when he is in a good mood and that everyone doesn't shift into a bad mood when he is in a bad mood."
Department employees make discrimination.
We are having equipment problems in our working environment. I suggest it to be solved.
I believe that we should receive more support from the service department. They should respect the efforts we make.
Our managers listen to us and care for us and help us. I believe that we do a good job as Hilton family.
Wish you success. c 21
I am very happy to be working at this hotel.
I am proud of being a part of the Hilton family.
I am extremely glad to be working here.
CONRAD ISTANBUL HOTEL SHOULD GIVE MORE IMPORTANCE TO CAREER DEVELOPMENT. THE STAFF MEMBERS HERE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SAME TITLE FOR YEARS.
More social activities can be held to motivate the staff more. It can ensured that staff members are integrated better by arranging organization both within and between departments.
I would like to thank the hotel management for their support during this challenging period we are going through...
"Ms. Meltem and Mr. G&Atilde;&para;ksun, our front office and human resources managers always give me professional motivation. They are the reason for the service quality of my work. I would like to pay my respects to them."
There is no peace in this department.
My department managers are not active enough when it comes to solving problems and there is favoritism.
We work with some dangerous chiefs unhappily. They exert every kind of pressure for the older staff members to quit.
Renovation of the hotel is over but it used to be better before. They made it with cheap materials of poor quality. It could have been done better and stronger.
My manager is a really self-ordained person. He wants everything to be as he wants. This of course leads to psychological pressure on the assistants and too much working load on the staff during the day and gives harm to the staff members psychologically and physically.
I feel very happy to be working at Hilton.
"The working environment here is definitely not healthy. The reason is obvious. The department manager exerts psychological pressure, doesn't provide the appropriate working environment and behaves in a stubborn way. And that's why there is no appropriate working environment at our hotel. Since he started to work in this position, some of my colleagues have quit their jobs and have had health issues. Some of them even applied to the court. Please we kindly ask for your help, it might be better, I am sure of that."
"Conrad hotel is the best and the most qualified hotel I have worked at. I feel very lucky to be working here because the service provided to the guests are provided to the staff members, as well. People who work here and discredit here must be really worthless people. I am very happy with my hotel as well as my colleagues and managers. I want to thank everyone who contributed to this."
"In our department, grouping is at an extreme level. Especially the evening chief discriminates between groups. In the daytime, the staff members who act like chiefs under the title of training exert pressure on us."
"Hi, first of all, I have always been proud of working at this hotel but for the last 5 years, there has been unbelievable pressure and despotism exerted on the staff. They don't care and they create stress all the time, which leads to demotivation among the staff members. Our latest manager does everything he can to make our work more difficult. Unfortunately, our motivation is extremely low. Together with the inexperienced chiefs, all they care about is how to exert more pressure on the staff. We want to have a proper working environment as was the case in the past. Ms. H&Atilde;&para;r&Atilde;&frac14;, Mr. Mustafa Kemal Torun, Ms. B&Atilde;&frac14;&Aring;Ÿra Ta&Aring;Ÿk&Auml;&plusmn;ran and Mr. Halit Yavuz and Mr. Mustafa Akba&Aring;Ÿ, these are the evening chiefs and they work solely to oppress the staff. Besides, the staff manager never helps the staff members and does nothing but give unkind answers to them. I hope that this pressure is removed as soon as possible. Regards."
I am proud of working at Conrad Hotel. We are provided with the facilities to help us.
It is a privilege to be working here.
"My manager may be acting and thinking in good faith but some colleagues around him lead him badly. Mustafa Akba&Aring;Ÿ definitely leads him badly. Halit and Mustafa are receiving training to become chiefs but they go there not for training but only to insult, smear and humiliate their colleagues. If I were the manager, I would only listen to Fatih Y&Atilde;&frac14;ksel and noone else. Additionally, morning shifts at nine annoy me and my colleagues a lot. I hope that we go back to our previous shifts soon. Best Regards. "
"Conrad has lost its grandeur in the last few years. They minimized quality for the sake of saving. Nowadays, they don't even hire floor supervisors in order to make savings. A few employees act like supervisors when they haven't even finished training. And they suck up as much as possible with the hope of becoming the supervisor but they favor some people they feel close to. This is a problematic subject. There is Ms. B&Atilde;&frac14;&Aring;Ÿra, the chief, noone else can insult better than her and of course the assistants favor her. The management talks about Hilton standards while they don't follow them at all. They act like Pollyanna. There is a lot more to write about but I have no time. I only want discrimination to be prevented and to have shift changes continuously on behalf of the employees working with shifts."
"We are happy with our hotel but not with the management. We have no peace in the department. We are all demotivated. There are people who spoil the peace. HAL&Auml;&deg;T YAVUZ, KEMAL TORUN, MUSTAFA AKBA&Aring;ž, THESE PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS AND LEAD TO DISTURBANCE."
I love my hotel and I feel very lucky to be working here.
"We used to start work at 8:00 AM before as the hotel housekeeping. During the last 2 months, we start to work at 9:00, which demotivates us too badly. We still get on the shuttle in the morning to come to our working place. We have to wait from 6:00 AM until 9:00 AM, the time we start to work. Even if we don't use the shuttle, we again have to leave home at 6:00 AM in order to avoid the morning traffic. In the evenings, we get stuck in the traffic again. As a result, I wake up at 5:30 in the morning and get home at around 19:30 or 20:00 in the evening. I kindly ask you to change the time to start to work as 8:00 AM again, which would be very good for us. I believe that we can work more efficiently at our workplace."
Staff rate cannot be reached in any destination. It is really sad that it failed although it was tried every week in big cities for the next one year.
Hilton is a very good place to work.
"I would like to thank Ms. Selen who is working in the human resources department for the attention and sincere behaviour she shows to us. She is doing a great job as a human resources staff member. In the past, when Ms. Selen used to be the nurse, we could refer to her only when we had a headache but now we can visit her when we are in trouble, as well. It gives us trust and motivation to work with such team members. Endless thanks."
"I hope that my manager will maintain his managing skills in the future, as well."
Further programs for development and training are required from HR. From expert companies.
"Our manager cares for us and listens to us and tries to help us as much as possible. But we expect support for the senior management, as well."
I am very proud of working with the Hilton family.
My managers are trying their best by displaying extraordinary performance. It makes me very happy to be a member of such a team.
Thank you.
We and our manager will always continue to work successfully for our hotel as much as possible.
My manager is not objective. He doesn't appreciate our efforts.
"I hope that my manager maintains his management skills in the future, as well."
"We all expect that our manager maintains his sincere approach towards us and continues to motivate us all the time for our work in the following years, as well."
"We hope that our manager maintains his management skills in the future, as well."
We are proud of our manager and we are very happy.
We don't have enough staff in our kitchen and we don't have enough materials. We have problems with the customers. We want to solve these issues as soon as possible.
I am very happy at work. It is an honour to work at Hilton.
I want more equal treatment.
"If we make an evaluation according to the sectors, our hotel is a reason for preference thanks to the financial possibilities it offers to us. The only thing that makes me feel bad is that they don't have a mission of planning and evaluating our careers as HR."
"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY MANAGER, HE TRIES TO HELP US AS MUCH AS HE CAN WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND ANSWERS EVERY QUESTION WE ASK."
I am happy to be working here.
I am happy with my supervisors. My hotel cares about the satisfaction of our guests and our chiefs guide us all the time. We do our best to satisfy our guests.
Hilton is a good hotel to work at.
I am very happy with my work and hotel. I am thankful for this taking into account the current conditions.
I am glad to be under the roof of Hilton.
I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE IN THIS DEPARTMENT.
I have been working at this hotel for 22 years and it is my second home. I am lucky that Hilton exists and everything is possible at Hilton.
"I feel proud of being a member of Hilton. It is wonderful to be a part of a family that makes me feel safe, peaceful and great!"
I am happy to be working here.
I am proud to be a part of the Hilton family. Endless thanks to my manager for the support he gives to me.
Qualified staff support should be taken into account for professional work.
OF COURSE ONE DAY
I believe that our facility is in a good condition and we try to keep the satisfaction level of our guests at the maximum level.
"I have learned how we can be successful with few employees, equipment and products despite our restricted budget due to insufficient environmental income support as well as location and hotel conditions. I have learned the importance of a term like crisis management. I have learned and taught that there is nothing we can't manage as long as we work as a team."
I AM NOT SURE THAT I AM WORKING AT HILTON.
I am very happy with my working place.
"Everything is as it should be, thanks."
I am very happy with the management.
"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH HILTON, HERE IS MY HOME."
"WE LOVE OUR MANAGER DESPITE ALL THE INJUSTICES, I WISH WE COULD WORK UNDER EQUAL CONDITIONS."
It is good in general.
"I happy with my team in general, and especially with my manager and I feel very lucky to be working with this team and especially with my manager at this hotel."
"I am working in an environment where I am not appreciated or supported. Nobody congratulates or thanks me when I achieve something. And in case of mistakes, I am subject to threats rather than guidance. It won't contribute to me or to my working place when I work in an environment where I am not motivated and happy. Our supervisors should be aware of this. Unfortunately, I don't feel as valuable as before. I don't want the quality of the staff and the standards of Hilton to be ignored."
"If other employees/supervisors/managers were to identify with their jobs and act accordingly, this hotel would once again rise to meet its famously lofty status."
putting a bit more pressure on me to keep to deadlines and drive projects forward
All okay
Create new structures that meet the expected standards of quality.
being stricter with the trainees.
recruiting more staff
All positive
We're doing well
So far so good
All okay
So far so good
Recruit more employees!!! Take more time to get to know the trainees.
"Rules for professional training leave (if one is a trainee), for instance. Prompt logging of overtime (does not apply to all departments)"
training for the departments
accepting advice and criticism from trainees
"Wine classes, tea training and other theme-based training sessions or courses could be offered. Basic information, production, types of service, etc. These things could be demonstrated in a more practical way than at a formal school."
Everything's fab &acirc;€“ I like being here
Everything's okay
I am very satisfied with my training at the Hilton
Mostly fun
gathering and evaluating feedback from guests
I think everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

"introducing practical training, visiting the individual departments more often and asking for suggested improvements."
Greater trust
experimenting more and trying out new dishes
TEAM PARTY! (OUTING)
You can really experience the OEX here!
Rigorous monitoring
"More equipment for RS, VB, PC and Banqueting."
"Guest survey, although this has already been done by supervisors and MoD on many occasions"
"ensuring better communication between the kitchen and service; providing info about changes and processes; giving an overview of successful endeavors in order to improve these even further and as an impetus for new initiatives. CM meetings between service and kitchen staff. Perhaps coffee stations for guests / preparing coffee for guests once a week, e.g. frapp&Atilde;&copy; in summer and R&Atilde;&frac14;desheimer Kaffe in winter."
Recruit staff! The service pool should apply to ALL employees! Unfair double standards apply in this hotel!
Start recruiting more staff!
trusting
"Chill out! You act as though we're all modern and young-spirited, but in reality this hotel and the GL have a completely outdated notion of how everything has to run here!"
listening
More regular appraisals
replacing equipment
"Both more targeted support and further development from the BL, and greater feedback on satisfaction with the employee's performance"

"Ask employees if they have any suggestions for improvement, e.g. at the project handover"
"There's a lack of natural light in Housekeeping. The ventilation system is constantly running in HSK, which is very disruptive."
conducting random checks on guest rooms
"A performance review could be held every month, with one for each department."
taking over the late shift by yourself
identifying challenges as a team in meetings and then brainstorming solutions
"Sticking to deadlines for OeX projects. There have been too many projects that we haven't completed and that have been on the table for several months. This has undermined trust in the team. Prioritise tasks and allocate work better when there are periods of heavy workload in the short and medium term due to changes to the team (dismissal, illness, departmental changes)."
Back of house &acirc;€“ renovate offices
showing your face more in the individual departments.
putting in more of an appearance in the departments. Encourage team spirit between the departments.
"communicating more openly about goals that have been reached, 'celebrating targets met'"
sharing more best practice
"We need more employees who have fun at work, and make work pleasant without seeking to become a manager. I think that you should keep and look after employees who just want to work so that they can earn money to live and enjoy their lives and free time. Simply living in a settled way and having a good work&acirc;€“life balance."
"We need more staff in the kitchen to teach and instruct the trainees, rather than just leaving trainees alone at their posts."
We have a really good team spirit and also get on very well with the management.
paying more; tips should be allowed to be kept
Keeping to deadlines
sticking to deadlines

"ensuring better, targeted waste sorting"
purposefully recruiting more staff in the various departments
implementing ideas and establishing or building on commitment; taking the next step 
also criticizing older employees if they do things wrongly
rewarding OeX ideas better
"More OeX in the kitchen, except for the extra sweet dishes in the morning at breakfast. Assess what the guests like best to eat!"
Listen more to the team.
"writing employee-friendly schedules, not ever-changing shifts. No early shift after the night shift, where you only get the day free after the night shift has ended. If you are on holiday or have annual leave, no night shift the day before; it would be great if we could have the early shift on the day before instead. Have a better sense of who on the team is acting fairly or unfairly in relation to work and the team itself."
"pass on, set out and define information for everyone in a concise way"
social media selling
"giving greater consideration to suggestions and then really putting these into practice, rather than dropping them halfway."
Faster training programs
showing his face
observing and discussing work more closely with employees in the operational area

more team meetings and rounds of feedback
renovating rooms
"Those flying should check out earlier &acirc;€“ 14.00 would be better, 15.00 at the latest."
"advertising the hotel's strengths more, such as the breakfast buffet. Start renovating the guestrooms."

"Nothing, all fine."

setting aside more time for us
listening to the team
reducing paperwork

"integrating more into own team, adopting a more open way of working, delegating tasks, motivating team members, giving feedback (except for PDRs), practice personal integrity by demonstrating fairness and objectivity towards all team members."
"making sure that all team members have opportunities for development. Giving feedback, motivating employees. Also provide information verbally, instead of pointing to the red folder containing the info. Learn fairness, objectivity and generosity, and involve us more in different projects."
I would love to have a fixed area.
"The wages are very low and urgently need to be adjusted. Turnover is always very high, so I don't understand the situation."
"He could talk to the sous chefs as a whole more often, possibly once a quarter to avoid any instances of non-compliance. Communicate more with the different sub-divisions and individual team members."
"I hope that 'my boss' means the head of department, as my head of department has always supported, encouraged and backed me. If 'my boss' refers to the management, in other words the directors, this comment doesn't apply! As these people pay me absolutely zero respect as a human being! What's more, these people have very little idea of what the everyday work of people in my department is like &acirc;€“ my team and I are always getting stabbed in the back and having obstacles put in our way. At this point it is very difficult to still identify with the hotel due to the viewpoint of the management, so I would never recommend the hotel as a place to work to my friends or family."
having trust in me; having an interest in my department
Treat everyone equally; spend more time with team members

"I'm still quite new, so I can't comment."

traveling expenses
OnQ problems shouldn't happen regularly. People can't work quickly and efficiently if the program that they're using doesn't let them. Start to use a more efficient program.
"involving us in projects (prior information given in a timely fashion, detailed plans set out) and motivating us by addressing us directly and communicating their expectations, instead of doing it through the Ass.FOM."
"Paper-free office (payroll, training, etc.)"
having more to do with individual employees. Allocate points of contact in the different departments for trainees. Schedule and carry out exit interviews.
"If possible, participate more in the operational area (service)"
Give more direct criticism to team members
time management
Be stricter in clamping down
Stricter monitoring and consequences for the cleaners
"In order to improve upon the SALT results, my boss could look at training new cleaners, firstly to determine whether the process is working, and secondly so that the cleaners can show whether they know what they're doing. This would also show my boss that she is respected by the cleaners, making it easier for her to do her job. And the cleaners would know what they had to do."
Greater equality
giving more feedback
- Staff food is so-so &acirc;€“ apart from the salad there is little in the way of fresh/healthy dishes. Little variety on Veggie Day (i.e. curry every week). Food is often cold.
"Negatives: *Staff food is so-so. Strange combinations or simply not enjoyable. Sometimes cold, but often heated up and overcooked. Veggie Day food is lacking in vitamins and uninspired, with curry and rice. *Back of house staff (e.g. clothing) tattered and musty. *Hotel rooms and facilities in the conference rooms are no longer presentable in some cases. *Problems aren't resolved effectively or in a timely fashion."
"Positives: the heads of department of the restaurant/BQT/GC&amp;E/Accounting are always willing to listen to their employees and try to address requests and suggestions, or decline them by offering a good explanation - new Team Member Restaurant - tastings of new dishes"

Better monitoring of work by GRG employees
"Salary, free meals"
prioritizing atmosphere among the staff
"Body grooming: the requirement to completely get rid of beards is outdated. Banning beards on grounds of hygiene, or for cultural or fashion reasons, is unacceptable. In Berlin, where so many influences from culture and fashion meet, most of the hotel's male guests have beards and wouldn't be bothered by a well-kept beard on one of the employees. The beard ban has a very negative effect on private life (partner's and friends' reactions). Making a change to this policy is highly desirable; in fact, it's a necessity."

"There must be more unity in the team and communication must be improved. Everyone is really only working for him- or herself at the moment and says that it does not feel like a team. How can we resolve this? This is down to the manager, I guess. It is great to get feedback, but it must be built on. So we do not need to spend a whole morning listening to what mistakes have been made and what is not going well, but how we can resolve this and what we can do to improve the situation. Also all shift leaders and supervisors must be on the same page. It is very confusing if one is saying one thing, the other something else. One wants to do it like this, the other always does it like that. Perhaps the manager needs to train shift leaders better so that there is simply uniformity across the board. It will do a lot for collaboration and team spirit, I think. (Morning service) "

The chairs are outdated and I often prefer not taking a seat through the whole shift as it lowers my motivation to work and does not enhance my comfortability in any way, shape or form throughout a shift. It only hinders the effeciency of my job and impedes me at times because they are built cheaply and are not suited for their intentional use."

"there must be satisfaction surveys on the desks. guests sometimes do not see them. so we can't understand if they are satisfied or not. it would be good if there were small feedback forms where they can write their room numbers, names, the date and their opinions. we can improve ourselves regarding the issues that guests are not satisfied about or get motivated knowing that they are satisfied"

The fact that the salaries of myself and the staff in general affect the technical service negatively. They should start raising the salaries to more efficient levels.

"first of all, those who work and who only seem to be working should be distinguished. At the end of the job, those who do it should be motivated and even more importantly, the salary for technical service should not be as low as the minimum job rate.

"dealing with employees on a more individual basis &acirc;€“ providing training, asking for any questions or feedback; making attendance at communication meetings compulsory; if possible, a monthly training plan for each member of staff. More efficient and employee-friendly duty rosters. Highlight spontaneity and flexibility as a standard towards which all members of staff should aspire. Less carrot, more sturdy stick. As far as I'm aware, F&amp;B/Banqueting/HSK also fall under Operations, so it would be appropriate to check in with the Operations Manager every now and then, rather than just for inspections or a VIP event. One suspects that this would also underline authenticity."

being more open about the figures; being critical
motivating
"addressing employees as 'du', like AFOM. Everything else is fine."
"holding monthly HSK and FO team meetings. This would allow us to discuss the month's shortcomings in terms of lost and found, pending rooms, etc., so that we can improve communication between the departments. Provide special mirror cleaning cloths and substances for us and the cleaners. Gradually update the CRM, as this sometimes has fairly old comments and is missing important information."

"Bigger selection of salads in the canteen, especially in summer"

- saying hello/goodbye when entering/leaving the office; welcoming new employees/trainees when they first join the department
"getting more involved in the department. In particular, welcome new trainees and give them an induction. Avoid constant insults and bitching within the department. Treat all trainees equally, rather than bullying some of them. Provide the trainees with more work, too, and show them how to do more, so that more work can be covered."

"having employees' backs, rather than stabbing them in the back; actually get involved in work, rather than sitting around pointlessly"
"having more to do with employees in order to build a better relationship and enhance wellbeing among the staff. We don't know our GM at all. He should also start appreciating our work more and not just see it as a source of profit. That's exactly what makes our industry look bad. Overtime, poor pay and no recognition."
sharing more info with staff
"As far as I can see, everything has been arranged and is being carried out as best it can."
allowing more freedom to put forward ideas
giving more praise for good work
letting departments work independently
"Giving trainees more instruction; putting information on processing cancellations, changing bookings, etc. in a clear spreadsheet that can be used by everyone. If an employee is struggling, try to discuss the issue one-to-one and talk about any weaknesses so that he/she has the opportunity to improve. This will also have a positive effect on the team as a whole."
"recruiting more staff, so that we can provide guests with better service."
"If something goes wrong, don't be head-on and personal: constructive criticism is better than taking things personally, expressing disappointment and making employees/trainees feel useless or incapable. It's not very fair."
displaying a good mood in the workplace to motivate trainees
being honest
"Being a role model. Praise employees, seek to promote people, rather than just promising it but looking to secure one's own promotion rather than that of others."
"- Taking greater care over duty rosters - Communication, especially now, in the changeover phase. I don't identify in any way with the new hotel concept, unfortunately. - Have more confidence in us"
"Making a new start is always difficult, but over the 10 months that she's been here, Annalin has convinced me that we can do a lot as a team."

  "
To familiarize himself with the work of his colleagues from the same sector with the view to improving
